The Open Source Security Assessment Management System (OSSAMS) will be presented, which is a framework for the automation, data collection, analysis, and reporting in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment efforts. OSSAMS is written in Python and allows for the processing of tool results, parsing and normalizing the data, extraction of meaningful information via query, and more effective analysis.
